# **Team Contract (csarai2-rahulvk2-anamivp2-aryat2)** <h1>


## Communication
  1. Team Meetings: <br />
      Our team will meet once a week every Monday 4:00 - 5:00 PM using Zoom or in person. Each
      member will rotate taking meeting notes, beginning with Anami. We will store our notes
      on a Google document for each meeting. 
  2. Assistance: <br />
      Each team member can be contacted through email or via text. We will commit to responding
      within 24 hours, exceptions can be made for emergencies.
  3. Respect: <br />
      Each of the team members will commit to being respectful of other's ideas and encouraging
      other team members to share their opinions. The team will make an active effort to being
      open-minded.
      
## Collaboration
  1. Work Distribution: <br />
      The team will decide on the deliverables for the week and each member will volunteer to 
      work on certain parts and have them ready for the next meeting. If a certain task is
      difficult it can be assigned to 2 or more members so that they can collaborate. In the
      case of an unbalanced workload, adjustments can be made based on a weekly basis.
  2. Time Commitment: <br />
      To ensure an equal division of work among the members, we expect the team members to each
      contribute between two and six hours each week. If a task is exceedingly difficult or takes
      an excessive amount of time, other team members should be pulled in to help out. The entire 
      team commits to making sure a certain amount of progress is made each week.
      
      In the case of issues or conflicting commitments, the team member will be asked to explain
      their situation and the team will try to resolve the issue in an efficient manner. If it is
      necessary, the mentor will be contacted in an effort to solve the problem.
  3. Conflict Resolution: <br />
      In the case of disagreements between team members, the issue will be brought up to the team
      where we will try to come up with a diplomatic solution or compromise. In the case that we are
      absolutely unable to resolve the issue, our mentor will be contacted.
